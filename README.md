CS 279: Research Topics in Human-Computer Interaction

Final Project

We hope to develop a generalizable model of any task's engagement space, as affected by the intrinsic incentives of the task (interest of the task to the user) and the different types of external incentives that can be incorporated into the way in which the task is presented. Just as comprehensive user studies can provide us with models of motor control of devices or of color perception, carefully designed experiments can help us develop models of responses to incentives that can be used to predict levels of user engagement in other settings. Further testing of the model on other tasks would allow us to determine whether or not elements of such incentive schemes are universal. Such a model would take some of the guesswork out of game design and make developing engaging tasks a more straightforward process that is task-aware and effective.
