        <p class = "large-text dark">It was about people's <strong> willingness to provide information </strong> of various levels of sensitivity either with or without notification of their peers' decisions.</p>

        <p> There were two different conditions in this study: <em> with </em> information about others' decisions and <em> without </em> this information.Those in the <em> with </em> condition were given a prompt for each field informing them that "[X] other people have answered this". In reality, these amounts were entirely fictitious.</p>

        <p> However, it is true that <strong> no actual data has been stored </strong> &#8211; only a "true" or "false" value has been recorded representing whether information was provided or ommitted for a certain field.</p>

        <p class = "large-text"> If you would like to be notified of the results of this study, please enter your e-mail (this time it will actually be recorded!):

        <input type="email" pattern="[^ @]*@[^ @]*" value="">
        <input type="submit" value="Submit"/>
