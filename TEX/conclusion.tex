\section{Conclusion}
This study represents a preliminary foray into an integrated theory of gamification based on both the psychological principles of reinforcement and attention, as well as contemporary research in HCI about the effects of various incentive schemes on motivational variables. Our primary contribution is in devising a potential methodology for quantifying the potency of different incentive-task combos.

Although several of our results were ambiguous, we believe that this course of research is far from being a dead end: we discovered surprising patterns in our data that indicate that although our incentives may not have unmistakable effects on engagement with the tasks, there are behavioral alterations associated with both differences between tasks and differences between incentives that deserve to be investigated further.
